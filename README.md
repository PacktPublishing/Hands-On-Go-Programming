This is the code repository for [Expert Geoserver](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/expert-geoserver?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789538601), published by Packt.

**Build and secure advanced interfaces and interactive maps**

## What is this book about?
GeoServer is open source, server-side software written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. In this book, you'll start by learning how to develop a spatial analysis platform with web processing services. Then you'll see how to develop an algorithm by chaining together geospatial analysis processes, which you can share with anyone in the world.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Develop a WPS-processing service to allow web-based geospatial data processing
* Find out which GeoServer settings resolve bottlenecks
* Develop an algorithm by chaining geospatial analysis processes together
* Understand how to develop an effective tile cache-supported web service
* Master techniques that ensure resilient server deployment

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02. Chapter 01 and 03 doesnot have code files. Also there is a image placed in the folder which represents the chapter structure.

The code will look like the following:
```
<wps:Data>
  <wps:LiteralData>Min</wps:LiteralData>
</wps:Data>
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
The main technical requirement is a PC running Windows, Linux, or macOS. Your PC should be running an OS from the last 5 years. The emphasis is on Windows with coverage of Linux, but Mac users will find the GUI approach in Windows most applicable to their own environment.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-4). Chapter 5 doesn't have code files

### Software and Hardware List
